# OilDatabaseManagement
A simple project in DBMS which shows trigers and stored procedures. The database is in oil_db.sql file.
# Flow
home.html is the default page which directs to an admin and a user page. Admin has the previlages to modify the data whereas the user can only view the data. I have used XAMPP for server and phpMyAdmin for the database.
